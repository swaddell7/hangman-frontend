# Hangman

* Hangman is a classic game that we all used to play as children. We revamped the game as a single page web application for users to play and test their skills.
* Hangman was a pair project during Mod 3 of Flatiron School! My partner is linked at the bottom of this ReadMe.

# Features I Worked On

* Implemented complex game logic using Ruby to distinguish between correct and incorrect guesses.
* Designed user interface using Javascript and CSS for styling
* Stored unique user gameplay and scoring to Ruby on Rails backend.

# Technologies

* Back-end was built using Ruby on Rails.
* Front-end was built using Vanilla JavaScript.
* Used basic CSS for styling.
